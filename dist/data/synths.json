        "description": "One of the most classic analog polysynths of the 80s, the Prophet 5 features five voices with two oscillators per voice, a fat resonant low pass filter, an LFO capable of modulating the pitch or pulse width and patch memory storage, which was revolutionary for the time. While it predated MIDI implementation by several years, it does have CV input for control of the VCA or filter cutoff. ",

VCO1 is switchable between any combination of triangle, sawtooth, pulse, and square oscillator and can be switched between 4 octaves. VCO2 has the same options, except the square oscillator is replaced by a noise generator switch and it has a 6 octave range, with an octave above and below VCO1's range.",

Though unlike its ancestors, it features 128 presets that can be saved and offer a quick switch between them â€“ that might have determined its popularity. This synthesizer supports MIDI control and responds to SysEx commands - it allows editing and uploading presets via computer.",

It had some pretty amazing features for its time such as eight voice polyphony, patch memory storage and polyphonic aftertouch. It can generate great analog strings, brass, drones and pads with that instantly recognizable classic polysynth sound. No synth sounds greater. Some examples of its extremely fat sound can be heard in 'Blade Runner' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty' by Vangelis as well as 'Dune' by Toto. ",

Compact, affordable, simplified and based on the megalithic modular Moog synths, the Minimoog became the most popular synth of all time, and still is to this day! Prior to the Minimoog, synthesizers were custom built to order, and required a great deal of technical knowledge to be able to wire up and create a sound.",

        "description": "At the time of its release, the Polysix, along with the contemporary Juno-6, was one of the first affordably priced polyphonic analog synthesizers. It cost about twice as much as the competing Juno-6 but had more features and 'real' VCOs in place of the Juno's DCOs. It also had on-board patch storage and backup which the cheaper Juno lacked until the upgraded Juno-60 model.",

Although it lacked the soon-to-be standard of MIDI control, later model Jupiter-8s did include Roland's proprietary DCB interface. The Jupiter-8 had many advanced features for its time, including the ability to split the keyboard into two zones with a separate patch active on each zone.",

Also, the Wave series is capable of recording filtering and wavetable changes in realtime.",
